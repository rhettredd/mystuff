		<h2>Story 1</h2>
		<p><b>A Hole in The Fence :</b></p>


<p>There once was a little boy who had a bad temper. His Father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, he must hammer a nail into the back of the fence.</p>


<p>The first day the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence. Over the next few weeks, as he learned to control his anger, the number of nails hammered daily gradually dwindled down. He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails into the fence....</p>


<p>Finally the day came when the boy didn’t lose his temper at all. He told his father about it and the father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper.</p>


<p>The day passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. He said, “You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one. You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won’t matter how many times you say I’m sorry, the wound is still there. A verbal wound is as bad as a physical one."</p>


<p>Friends and loved ones are a very rare jewel, indeed. They make you smile and encourage you to succeed. They lend an ear, they share a word of praise and they ahvays want to open their hearts to us. Water your relationships with kindness... and they will grow. So be careful little lips what you say...! And you won’t chase friendships away.</p>

		<h2>Story 2</h2>
		<p><b>The Neighbor :</b></P>


<p>Sayyed Jawad Ameli, a great Mujtahid, was having his dinner when someone knocked at his door.</P>


<p>A servant from his master, Ayatullah Savyed Mehdi Bahrul Uloom, appeared and said, "Your master has sent for you to come immediately. He has just sat down for his dinner but refuses to eat until he sees you."</P>


<p>There was no time to lose. Sayyed Jawad Ameli left his dinner and rushed to Ayatullah Bahrul Uloom’s residence. Just as he entered, the master looked disapprovingly at him and said, "Sayyed Jawad! You have no fear of Allah! Don't you feel ashamed in front of Allah?"</P>


<p>This came as a shock to him, as he could not remember doing anything to incur the wrath of his master.</P>


<p>He said, “My master may guide me where I have failed."


<p>Ayatullah Bahrul Uloom replied, “lt is now a week that your neighbor and his family are without wheat and rice. He was trying to buy some dates from a shop on credit but the shopkeeper refused to grant him any more credit. He returned home empty-handed and the family is without a morsel of food."</P>


<p>Saved Jawad was taken by surprise. "By Allah," he said, “I have no knowledge about this."


<p>“That is why I am displeased all the more. How can you be unaware of your own neighbor? Seven days of difficulties have passed and you tell me you do not know about it. Well, If you had known and ignored him despite your knowledge, then you would not even be a Muslim", Ayatullah Uloom adjoined.</P>


<p>Then he instructed him to take all the dishes of food before him to his neighbor. "Sit with him to eat, so that he does not feel ashamed. And take this sum for his future ration. Place it under his pillow or carpet so that he is not humiliated and inform me when this work is completed, for not until then shall I eat."</P>


<p>That man is not from me who sleeps contentedly while his neighbor sleeps hungry." Holy Prophet Muhammad. Peace be upon him.</p>
